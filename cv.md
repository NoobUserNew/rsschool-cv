## About me
---
Programming interested in the 5th grade, tried to learn turbo pascal, but because I just copied the code from the screen and did not understand how it works quickly abandoned. So I tried to learn many languages such as python, php, c++, c#, and so on. Then I got interested in frontend. I watched courses on youtube and managed to design a simple website. And now I am taking a course from "The Rolling Scopes School". My goal is to become a Middle Front Developer to do cool projects.
## My skills

## Example code

**Check same case:** Write a function that will check if two given characters are the same case.

If either of the characters is not a letter, return -1
If both characters are the same case, return 1
If both characters are letters, but not the same case, return 0
**Code:**
```javascript
function sameCase(a, b){
 if((a.toUpperCase() === a.toLowerCase()) || (b.toLowerCase() === b.toUpperCase())){
    return -1;
  }
  else if((a === a.toLowerCase() && b === b.toLowerCase()) || (a === a.toUpperCase() && b === b.toUpperCase())){
      return 1;
  }
  else{
    return 0;
  }
